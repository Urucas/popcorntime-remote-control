Popcorntime remote control for android
======================================

I was using Popcorn in the last few weeks and realize that there wasn't a remote control for the desktop app, so as a hobby I create the "Popcorntime Remote Control (Really)Beta Open Source Project". The idea is to launch this beta app and have some feedback from users. There are a few bugs to fix and also a lot to work on the UI (it's quite ugly).


The Remote Control works with this version of Popcorn;

Sorry, I could only create the Mac App.
