    <b> I\'m getting the error: \"Wifi connection is not enabled!\" ? </b><br /><br />
    Solution: <br />
    * Check that your Android phone is connected to Wifi <br/>
<br /><br />
    <b> I\'m getting the error: \"Sorry! The remote control cant connect to your Popcorn desktop app. Check the connection settings!</b>\"<br />
    <br />Solutions: <br />
    * Check that your Android phone and PC(or Mac) are connected to the same Wifi<br />
    * Check the connection host IP corresponds to your desktop app<br />
    * Check the connection settings(port, user, password) on your Popcorn desktop app<br /><br />

    <b>How cant I check my desktop app host IP ?</b><br /><br />
    Solution:<br />
    * Open Wifi Preferences on your desktop PC(or Mac) and it would show you the current IP(192.168.x.x). <br />We are currently working to automate this step, for the end of this week this will be implemented and you won\'t have to worry about it! </br><br />

     <br /><b>How cant I check my Popcorn desktop app settings(port,user,pass) ?</b><br /><br />
    Solution:<br />
    * In your Popcorn desktop app at the right top corner there\'s the Settings button. Tap it to enter the Popcorn app settings. Once in there check the \"Show advanced settings\" and scroll down to the Remote Control section. <br />Check the HTTP API Port, HTTP API Username, HTTP API Password in your desktop app are the same that the one\'s in your PT Remote Control app.<br /><br />
